# BonziWORLD
I decided to replicate the v1.3.3 build of the original **BonziWORLD.COM** website. The reason why I did this is because it's used for such meme chatting and entertainment purposes and nostalgias. BonziWORLD.COM, the original BonziWORLD, was created by heyjoeway (Joseph Judge) and is used by every people who remembered it. That's what I should thought. This is really the BonziWORLD respiratory since I created it on GitHub.


I am sorry if this server doesn't have rules, but sort of it does. I want users to still be _really_ fucking **careful** to not break the rules at all times.

## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm
- Ruby
- Sass
- Git
- Cordova (Optional)

## Setup
In a terminal/command prompt, navigate to where you'd like BonziWORLD to be placed and run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/ItzUltraChace/BonziWORLD-v1.3.3-Oldest-Version-Replica
cd BonziWORLD-v1.3.3-Oldest-Version-Replica
```

### Client
```
cd src
npm install
grunt build_www
cd ..
```

### Server
```
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```
After this, BonziWORLD will be accessible on port 80. (http://localhost:3000/)

## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible if you screw up anything with your computer while setting this up. I have no idea how you would, but someone will find a way. I also will not provide support for installing dependencies. If you have everything installed properly, the above commands will work.
